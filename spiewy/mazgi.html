My brain is tired 					
My thoughts are wrong				
And I’m surprised					
By voice in your phone.				
You gave me the chance				
But I get away						
And my hurt is blaze				
Because I should pay.				
									
Crazy feelings						
And we’re both in the boat 			
Celestial ceiling					
And we loose this road				
Your impassioned glance				
My broken fate						
You look at me gaze					
But I’m bored to wait.				
									
Our happy is finished				
We forgot our past					
I hate your perversity				
We meet at the last					
Your conclusion is right			
That is all for my life				
I will greater insight 				
And I’ll take for you knife.
